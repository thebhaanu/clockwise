[Live Demo](https://thebhaanu.github.io/clockwise/)

A World Clock that shows the time of every country (I think I have added every country). This website is made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

> ### This project is open-source, You can use the code anywhere just don't forget to mention.

## How it works?

The JavaScript takes the time from user's device and then calculate the UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) and from the UTC it calculates the time for each Country. 

## How I got the idea?
I was thinking about some other idea and this just struck my mind. The HTML and CSS are written by me and the Javasvript (learning) is written by ChatGPT.
